                <p>SLDFABRICS was born with a sole purpose of curating the best fabrics for people who don’t consider
                    their fabrics as just another “stash”. We look at fabrics as collections, to be used, admired, and
                    to be taken care of like any a valuable thing.</p>
                <p>At SLDFABRICS, we facilitate all the designers out there to create anything of their imagination using
                    an array of premium quality fabrics curated specially for you. These fabrics are sourced directly
                    from traditional fabric merchantswho are the masters of traditional craft. Sometimes the fabric
                    dictates the sort of garment you can make and at SLDFABRICS, you will notice that happening with you
                    quite a lot!</p>
                <p>To top it all we are based out of Surat, Gujarat which is the textile capital of the country. The
                    best yarn production, weaving, processing and even embroidery happen in Surat. Always adaptive to
                    the changes in the latest trends, the city has never failed torespond to the changing preferences of
                    people.</p>

                <h3>INCEPTION OF SLDFABRICS</h3>
                <p>SLDFABRICS was a community of designers to begin with, a community who believed in creating glorious
                    art out of a fabric. It was a community that explored town, streets and villages to curate the best
                    fabrics for their creation and a community that never compromised on the quality or the design of
                    the fabric. That’s the reason they could find all the loopholes and hardships that a designers faced
                    in bringing life to their imagination. </p>
                <p>SLDFABRICS came into existence recognising the need of making the best fabrics available to all the
                    creators out there without any “MINIMUM QUANTITY LIMIT”. Yes, you heard it right! SLDFABRICS doesn’t
                    just bring you a plethora of premium fabrics to choose from but also gives you an opportunity to
                    order the quantity of your choice. Be it a thousand meters fabric or just one we make sure we fulfil
                    your need without any terms and conditions.</p>
